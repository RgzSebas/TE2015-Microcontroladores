# **TE2015 Microcontroladores**

This repository aims to help you understand the topics covered in TE2015 Microcontroladores. Particulary, we will address the following:
* To understand the architecture of a PIC18 microcontroller
* To become familiar with PIC18 instruction set to develop firmware
* To carry out coding, programming and debugging of PIC18 firmware using MPLAB X IDE
* To interface a microcontroller with an external memory or peripheral using both, physical connections and driver develpment 
* To analyze the internal structure of a general purpose input/output port of the microcontroller
* To learn by doing on the develpment of timing-based firmware 
* To study serial communication protocols to communicate a microcontroller with an external device
